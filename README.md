# ubuntu_dev_pc

This repository will record issus when I used ubuntu 18.04 as my main system. 
Because I'm a linux/android developer, the system I used last time is win10, actualy, it's not so well for linuxer. 

So, I insall ubuntu 18.04 (destop version) system, and set it as my mainly system. Maybe some issues will
meet, but I will try and fix it, and recording it in this repository.

I mainly used this system to communicating/coding/building/loading:
  1. communicating with other people, I need wechat/qq/email and etc.
  2. coding for driver or linux application.
  3. building for android or linux sdk.
  4. loading image to devices.

  so, I will record these four parts.
